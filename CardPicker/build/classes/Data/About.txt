Based on code and requirements provided by Nico Cuvelski

This program provides information about the number of tries
required to draw 4 cards of DIFFERING suites. It can be
configured to provide this information based on shuffling
used cards back into the deck, or removing them from play
to try again (Settings option).

This data is stored based on the player playing, and can
provide a log of games previously played.
